# Overview

Pass variables can hold various types of data.
## Primitive values

All types except objects define immutable values (that is, values which can't be changed). For example (and unlike in C, Strings are immutable. We refer to values of these types as "_primitive values_".

### Boolean type

Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values:  `true` and  `false`. 

### Null type

The Null type has exactly one value:  `null`.

### Undefined type

A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value  `undefined`. 

### Number type
The Number type is a [double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format) (numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1).

### String type
String type is used to represent textual data.

## Objects

In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an  identifier(variable name).
