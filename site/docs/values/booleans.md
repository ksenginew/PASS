# true or false

 Boolean represents one of two values:  **true**  or  **false**.

## Boolean Values

Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

-   YES / NO
-   ON / OFF
-   TRUE / FALSE

```js
let css_is_awesome = false
let pass_is_awesome = true
```

## Comparisons and Conditions

Here are some examples:

Operator|Description|Example
-|-|-
`===`|equal to|`if (day == "Monday")`
`>`|greater than|`if (salary > 9000)`
`<`less than`if (age < 18)`

The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions.
