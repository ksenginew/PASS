# null and undefined

## null

In computer science, a  **`null`**  value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid  object or address. The meaning of a null reference varies among language implementations.

```js
let variable = null
```

## undefined

**`undefined`**  is a  primitive  value automatically assigned to  variables that have just been declared, or to formal  arguments for which there are no actual arguments.

```js
let variable = undefined
```
