# Integration for  [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Install

If you are proceeding setup with a custom webpack build, then please report any issues you find.

```bash
yarn add pass-loader -D 
# npm i pass-loader -D
```

## Configure
This is a minimal example for configure Webpack for pass

_webpack.config.js_
```js
export default = {
// for non ES modules, comment the above line and uncomment the following line.
// module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        // test: /\.pass\.ts$/i, // for typescript
        test: /\.pass\.js$/i,
        use: [
           // Other loaders...
          'pass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
With Webpack, Pass is useless without necessary loaders and plugins.
